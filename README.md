# Core diagrams

This is set of interactive or animated diagrams for the [MAS106 Core Mathematics](https://strickland1.org/courses/MAS106) course at the University of Sheffield.
I am only running tutorials for this course, not giving the lectures, so this repository will only cover a random selection of things.
